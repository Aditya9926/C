// Advantages of Pointers

// Following are the major advantages of pointers in C:
// Pointers are used for dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.
// An Array or a structure can be accessed efficiently with pointers
// Pointers are useful for accessing memory locations.
// Pointers are used to form complex data structures such as linked lists, graphs, trees, etc.
// Pointers reduce the length of the program and its execution time as well.


// Issues with Pointers

// Pointers are vulnerable to errors and have following disadvantages:
// Memory corruption can occur if an incorrect value is provided to pointers.
// Pointers are a little bit complex to understand.
// Pointers are majorly responsible for memory leaks in C.
// Accessing using pointers are comparatively slower than variables in C.
// Uninitialized pointers might cause a segmentation fault.
